  description: |
    The **VoucherPreactivation** API is used by a non Payment Building Blocks in the GovStack Framework to request for a voucher to be used. This call reserves the voucher (for a period of time, which is to be implemented). This API requests a single voucher from the voucher server that can be used for a future redemption process. The caller sends an amount, a voucher group (depending on the use case), the currency and the name of the calling GovStack Building Block. If the API call is successful, the Payment Building Block will respond with a voucher number, a voucher serial number and an expiry date.
- name: VoucherActivation
  description: |
    The **VoucherActivation** API is used by a non Payment Building Blocks in the GovStack Framework to activate a pre-activated voucher. This is second function call is intended to ensure that the voucher is only activated when it is disbursed. This API requests for the activation of a voucher when the caller sends the voucher number to be activated. If the API call is successful, the activation is confirmed and the voucher can now be used by the beneficiary.
- name: VoucherRedemption
  description: |
    The **VoucherRedemption** API is used by a non Payment Building Blocks in the GovStack Framework to redeem a voucher. The calling Building Block will capture the voucher number and the voucher serial number from the merchant point. The external Building Block will also acquire the merchant name and payment details from the merchant registry. The calling Building Block will then send the voucher number, the voucher serial number, the merchant name and payment details. The Payment Building Block will verify that the voucher has been activated and has not been used or blocked or cancelled. If so, the Payment Building Block will then send a payment request to the funding agency / FSP. The Payment Gateway of the Payments Building Block will facilitate the debit of the funding account, and the credit of the merchant as well as handle any intermediary fees. Once the payment has been successfully done the Payment Building Block will mark the voucher as consumed and notify the merchant (and beneficiary if possible).
- name: VoucherStatusCheck
  description: |
    The **VoucherStatus** API is used by a non Payment Building Blocks in the GovStack Framework to check the status of a voucher. The calling Building Block will capture the voucher number and send it to the Payments Building Block to determine the status of a voucher. The Payments Building will respond with one of the status of Pre-Activated, Activated,  Suspended, Blocked or Not Existing.
- name: VoucherCancellation
  description: "The **VocuherCancellation** API is used by a non Payment Building Blocks in the GovStack Framework to cancel a voucher. The calling Building Block will capture the voucher number and send it to the Payments Building Block to canel the voucher. The Payments Building Block will respond with a status of Cancelled, Already Cancelled or Not existing. The VoucherCancellation will override the Blocked status and render the voucher permanently unusable. \n"
