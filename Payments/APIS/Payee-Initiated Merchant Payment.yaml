    The purpose of this document is to specify the endpoints, fields, objects, and enumerations for Merchant Payment Mobile Money APIs, which are a subset of the GSMA Mobile Money API Specification. 
    The Merchant Payment Mobile Money APIs allow merchants to accept payments from mobile money customers. Supported payment mechanisms include:

    - Payee-initiated merchant payment. The merchant initiates the payment and the payer is requested to authenticate to confirm acceptance by the mobile money provider.

    - Payer-initiated merchant payment. The payer initiates the payment by specifying the merchant that is to be paid.

    - Merchant payment via pre-authorised payment code. The payer generates a payment authorisation code up to a maximum payment amount. The merchant then enters or scans (if rendered as a QR code) the payer’s code to perform the payment.

    Closed loop and open-loop merchant payments are supported by the Mobile Money API. Closed loop merchant payments occur where the payer and payee accounts reside with the same mobile money provider.
    Open loop payments occur where the payer and payee accounts reside with different mobile money providers.

    You can find out more about what the API can do for your business at [https://developer.mobilemoneyapi.io].

      Payer-initiated and payee-initiated merchant payments can be created and viewed using **Transactions** APIs. 
  - name: Accounts
    description: |
      Using the **Accounts** APIs, merchants can view payments for their account and view their account balance.

      **Identifying a Target Account**

      Two methods are provided for identifying an account, the single identifier method and the multiple identifiers method.

      Single Identifier Method:

      - In the scenario where one identifier suffices to uniquely identify an account, the following path is to be used: **/accounts/{identifierType}/{identifier}**.

      Multiple Identifiers Method:

      - Where a single identifier is not sufficient to identify an account, the following path is to be used: &#39; **/accounts/{accountIdentifier1}@{value1}${accountIdentifier2}@{value2}${accountIdentifier3}@{value3}**&#39;. The list of permitted account identifiers supported by the Mobile Money API can be found in the API documentation. As there can be multiple identifiers required to identify the target account, the path uses a &#39;$&#39; delimiter to separate each identifier, up to a limit of three account identifiers.    
  - name: Authorisation Codes
    description: |
      The **Authorisation** Codes APIs allow a payer to generate a payment code which when presented to the payee, can be redeemed for an amount associated with the code. 
      Authorisation codes can be set to expire. Note that expiry time can be specified via the API, however the mobile money provider 
      may mandate a common expiry period for all codes.
      Authorisation Codes can be used for pre-authorised codes for merchant payments. The customer generates a code which can be redeemed at a merchant.
  - name: Supporting
    description: |
      Supporting APIs consist of the following:

      - **Heartbeat API:** Used for monitoring purposes and establishes whether the system of an API provider is in a state that enables a client to submit a request for processing within established SLAs.
      - **Request State API** : Used to determine the state of an asynchronous request.
      - **Responses API** : In some circumstances, the client may not have received the final representation of the resource for which it attempted to create or update. The **Responses** API allows a client to identify and retrieve the final representation of the resource assuming that the resource was created.     
paths:
  # Transactions APIs. These support creation and viewing of financial transactions in singular and bulk.
